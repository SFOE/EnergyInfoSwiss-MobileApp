For the calculation of the peak load times, the data from Swissgrid's \"Energy Overview\" are used.

Therefore, significant over- or underestimations may occur at times.  The contributions of the individual customer groups to the savings are based on a model and must be understood as indicative. Switzerland-wide measured values of the consumption of these customer groups are not available.  Since the definition of peak load hours is based on analyses of historical time series, it is possible that in the current year, due to the many influencing factors, peak loads actually occur at different times than predicted.<em><p>",

The further back the figures go, the more reliable they are. The data comes from distribution grid operators, who report the data to Swissgrid on a monthly basis. This data can be incomplete or incorrect and is subsequently corrected. At best, this data from Swissgrid goes back 1 month. Timely measured consumption data are not available. Models are used to determine the current national consumption, including the consumption of the storage pumps. These models do not take into account the temperature development in Switzerland, but they do not take into account changes in the behaviour of the population, for example the reaction to calls to save energy. Such behavioural changes can only be recorded using measured consumption data.</p> <p><strong>Current final consumption over the last few weeks</strong></p> <p>The final consumption is the electrical energy consumed by the economy, transport and private households. Any efforts to save electricity can be interpreted from this graph, but must be considered purely indicative due to the data situation. The graph is based primarily on the data reported to Swissgrid in the past by distribution grid operators and subsequently corrected. Due to the uncertainties in the data on final consumption, the SFOE has had a model of final consumption specially developed using the latest data science methods such as machine learning.</p> <p><strong>Expert graph comparing data sources on national consumption including consumption of storage pumps.</strong></p> <p>Analyses show that there are various differences between the most important data sources on consumption. These differences are illustrated to enable an assessment of the information that has been circulating so far.

Different sources exist that follow different methodological approaches. Of these, the most reliable source is the SFOE statistics, which, however, only offer values on a monthly basis and are currently published with a delay of about 2 months.  In addition, there is data from Swissgrid, which is based on reports from the distribution grid operators. These data are based on measured values and are subject to uncertainties, as there are always false reports, subsequent reports and corrections by the distribution grid operators, sometimes up to 6 months after publication. In order to be able to provide current values, models must be used. These take into account past data and, in particular, SFOE statistics. For a current estimate of end consumption, the SFOE has had a data science model developed using modern machine learning. This model forecasts final consumption, but is only able to partially reproduce major changes in the population's behaviour.

  "kpi-gas-3_gassparziel.langtext": "<p>In view of the tight gas supply situation in Europe, Switzerland has voluntarily adopted the EU gas savings target out of solidarity with its European neighbours. It envisages cumulatively consuming at least 15% less gas in the winter months (October - March) than on average in the reference period from 2017-2022, resulting in a savings target of 3997GWh for Switzerland. <p><p>Much of the gas consumption is strongly dependent on the weather or temperature. With increasing cold, gas consumption for heating purposes increases. However, the savings target set by the EU and Switzerland is independent of the weather. If a winter month is comparatively mild, a lot of gas can be saved. If the weather is rather cool, savings efforts must be intensified. Therefore, the current deviation of the average temperature from the long-term normal temperature is shown in the image as an indication of whether the respective month was particularly warm or rather cool. In addition, the weather-adjusted monthly savings are shown. However, temperature is not the only factor influencing final consumption. <p><p>The trend arrow refers to the total savings to date from October compared to the average consumption for the same period from 2017-2022. If more than 15% was saved overall, it points upwards, but if less than 15% was saved, it points downwards. <p><p><em>Disclaimer Data<em><p><p><em>For the calculation to achieve the savings target, on the one hand, current data on monthly net import is used, which is validated by VSG. Net imports are not the same as final consumption. Since this data can only be used with a delay, the data on daily net imports is used for the respective previous month. They come from public sources and allow an estimate of the savings. Commercial and physical flows are mixed together. In contrast to final consumption, net imports include national consumption minus biogas injection into the natural gas grid (Swiss production). If transport and network losses, own consumption of the gas sector and conversions were deducted, the final consumption would result. However, no monthly data is currently available for these items. The weather adjustment of the figures is based on models of the SFOE and has a range of uncertainty that is not indicated for the sake of simplicity. Since the quality of the data from public sources is not satisfactory, the status with regard to the savings target cannot currently be checked on a daily basis. The FONES is working with the VSG on solutions with the involvement of the SFOE. <em><p>",

No additional measures are taken to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which means that the climate targets are unlikely to be met. <br> The ‘Net Zero’ scenario (ZERO), on the other hand, aims to reduce Switzerland's greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, i.e. to generate only as many emissions as natural and technical reservoirs can absorb. There are different variants of this scenario, as various technologies and developments could contribute to achieving the target: <br> 1) Baseline scenario (ZERO Basis): This scenario is based on current technological trends. It relies on an early and comprehensive increase in energy efficiency and increased electrification, particularly in the heating sector in cities. Synthetic fuels and hydrogen play only a minor role. Emissions from waste incineration and cement production are reduced by carbon capture and storage (CCS). Unavoidable emissions are offset by sinks or negative emission technologies (NET), which remove CO2 from the atmosphere. <br> 2) Variant A (ZERO A): This variant emphasises an even greater electrification of the energy system than the baseline variant. <br> 3) Variant B (ZERO B): Here, only moderate electrification is targeted. Instead, biogas, synthetic gases and hydrogen play a greater role in the energy supply. <br> 4) Variant C (ZERO C): Similar to variant B, this variant relies on moderate electrification, but here the focus is more on heating networks and liquid biogenic and synthetic fuels. <br> All variants of the ZERO scenario include measures to avoid emissions and the use of NET technologies when avoiding emissions is difficult. Priority is given to domestic measures, but international approaches to CO2 storage are also conceivable.  <br> The ZERO scenario thus shows various ways in which Switzerland can become climate-neutral, taking into account different technologies and strategies.</p>",
